# MC_real_estate_calculator
A mini-program for a Minecraft role-play server that define the price of a house according to all parameters.

This app is developed in Ruby 2.6.3 and use GTK+ 2 as graphic library.

I plan to use an Ruby interpreter for being able to install and run this app on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.
